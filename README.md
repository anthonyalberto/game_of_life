# Game of Life
Go implementation of Conway's Game of Life

**Under development**

## Goals
- Outputs to terminal
- Implement cell state computation using goroutines
- Provide an interface for the Board. Implement different boards (regular, toroidal)
- Provide a parser that reads initial state from file
- Provide common pattern files
- Options will include : height and width of the board, board type, initial state file


## Left to do
- Implement goroutine to calculate each cell nextState
- Write proper doc
- Add more json patterns!
